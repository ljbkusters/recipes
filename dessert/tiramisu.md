# instructions

  Whip yolks and powdered sugar creamy-white. Mix in Amaretto. 
  In small batches (spoons-worth amounts), mix in the mascarpone.
  Don't use a mixer here or the whole will become (too) liquid.
  Preferably, use a whisk.
  Whisk the eggwhites into a stiff mass. Mix into the whole.
  Dip the ladies fingers into the espresso and let them drop off
  on some paper towels.

  Put one layer of the cream in a bowl or other container.
  Add one layer of ladies fingers and then another layer of cream.
  Repeat until no cream is left.

  Shortly before serving, add the coco powder / chocolate raspings.
