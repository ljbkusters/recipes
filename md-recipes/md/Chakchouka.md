## Description
Chakchouka (also spelled shakshuka or shakshouka) is a dish of eggs poached in a sauce of tomatoes, olive oil, peppers, onion and garlic, and commonly spiced with cumin, paprika, cayenne pepper and nutmeg. The dish has existed in Mediterranean cultures for centuries.

## Ingredients

+ 3 tablespoons olive oil
+ 1 1/3 cups chopped onion
+ 1 cup thinly sliced bell peppers, any color
+ 2 cloves garlic, minced, or to taste
+ 2 1/2 cups chopped tomatoes
+ 1 teaspoon ground cumin
+ 1 teaspoon paprika
+ 1 teaspoon salt
+ 1 hot chile pepper, seeded and finely chopped, or to taste
+ 4 eggs


## Instructions

Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion, bell peppers, and garlic; cook and stir until the vegetables have softened and the onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
Combine the tomatoes, cumin, paprika, salt, and chile pepper into a bowl and mix briefly. Pour the tomato mixture into the skillet, and stir to combine.
Simmer, uncovered, until the tomato juices have cooked off, about 10 minutes. Make four indentations in the tomato mixture for the eggs. Crack the eggs into the indentations. Cover the skillet and let the eggs cook until they're firm but not dry, about 5 minutes.
