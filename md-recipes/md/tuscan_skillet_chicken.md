# Preparation

  In a large cast iron skillet heat oil over medium heat, 
  add the cubed chicken pieces and cook for about 8 minutes on both sides, 
  until cooked through. Remove chicken and transfer to a plate.

  Add 1 Tbsp of olive oil to the skillet and sauté the sliced mushrooms 5 – 7 minutes 
  until the mushrooms are tender and the juices have evaporated. Set aside.

  Add another 1 Tbsp olive oil to the skillet and the diced onion. 
  Sauté the onions 3 – 4 minutes until translucent. 
  Add the minced garlic to the onions and sauté together one more minute. 
  Add salt and pepper to taste while cooking.

  Add 1 Tbsp olive oil to the skillet and toss the diced tomatoes, 
  sun-dried tomatoes, Cannellini beans, and black olives. 
  Season again with salt and freshly ground black pepper. 
  Sprinkle in the oregano, thyme and drizzle the balsamic vinegar and honey. 
  Stir a few minutes.

  Next, add the cooked chicken and mushrooms to the 
  skillet – stir and cook 1-2 minutes, or until chicken is heated through. 
  Add more salt and pepper if needed.

  Serve hot, garnished with the fresh basil.
